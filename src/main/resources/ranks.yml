# RANKS CONFIGURATION FILE FOR RANKGRANT+ BY DEMENG7215 #
# This is where you can customize basically everything that has to do with ranks in RankGrant+. #
# Everything in this file should be clearly explained. For questions, use the support options. #
# Below is the configuration example/explanation, followed by the actual configuration. #
# |
# Do not edit this value.
# config-version: 1
# |
# Should RankGrant+ search for your server's ranks automatically and list them in the GUI?
# WARNING: This means that owner, admin, and other potentially dangerous ranks will show.
# It is recommended you list ranks you want to show manually for full customization and safety.
# This value can be either "true" or "false".
# auto-list-ranks: true
#|
# The default format of rank buttons in the GUI.
# NOTE: This will only work if the configuration option above is set to TRUE.
# item = the material that will be shown in the GUI (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html)
# name = the display name of the item
# lore = the item description
# You can use the placeholders %rank% for the group name and %target% for the player that is getting the rank.
# default-format:
#  item: "NETHER_STAR"
#  name: "&2%rank%"
#  lore:
#    - "&f&m                                                          "
#    - "&aClick to grant &f%target% &athe &f%rank% &arank."
#    - "&f&m                                                          "

# This is a very important configuration section if you DO NOT WANT TO AUTO-LIST RANKS.
# This is where you list all your ranks and customize each rank item in the GUI.
# To add a rank, simply start a new configuration section by the name of the group in your permission plugin.
# Then, fill out the slot, item, name, lore, and special permission required to grant this rank.
# slot = the slot number in the GUI, 1 being the first slot
# item = the material that will be shown in the GUI (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html)
# name = the display name of the item
# lore = the item description
# permission = the permission required to grant this rank,
# set as rankgrantplus.grant to allow anyone who has access to the GUI to grant the rank.
# You can use the placeholders %rank% for the group name and %target% for the player that is getting the rank.
# ranks:
#  Admin:
#    slot: 1
#    item: "REDSTONE"
#    name: "&4&lAdmin"
#    lore:
#      - "&cClick me to get the awesome ADMIN rank and get"
#      - "&csome cool admin permissions! :)"
#    permission: "rankgrantplus.grant"
#  Cool:
#    slot: 9
#    item: "NETHER_STAR"
#    name: "&b&lCOOL GUY"
